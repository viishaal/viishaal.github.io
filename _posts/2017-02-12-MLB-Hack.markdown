For this one day hackathon at NYC Medialabs, we conceptualised and prototyped a virtual reality-based product that would allow for more immersive user experience in content browsing and ingestion. This was our dig at thinking through the VR search interface of the future. 
Taking the top down approach we thought about problems in storing/indexing and retrieving large amount of multi-modal data and then analysed capabilities of VR representations that could lead to potential solutions for this problems.

Working with VR technology stack for the first time; we imported Assets from Sketchup into Unity for our final demo. The slides with link to the demo is [here][slides].
