This is first in the series of exploratory posts to analyze Hillary Clinton's email [corpus][data]. A lot of [work][kaggle] has already been done in pursuit of gathering insights from this dataset. I will specifically focus on discovering policy standpoints/perceptions pertaining to the Republic of India.

This specific post is inspired from [this work][kaggle-wc]. The altered code to generate the below wordcloud image can be obtained from this [link][code].

The above wordcloud in generated from sample of emails mentioning `India`. You can analyze the full size image [here][full-size].

In the next post I will try to figure out which countries are mentioned most frequently when discussing India (probably a graph visualization).
