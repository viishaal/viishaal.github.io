<p>This is first in the series of exploratory posts to analyze Hillary Clintonâ€™s email <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/hillary-clinton-emails/downloads/hillary-clinton-emails-release-2015-09-11-01-39-01.zip">corpus</a>. A lot of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/hillary-clinton-emails/kernels">work</a> has already been done in pursuit of gathering insights from this dataset. I will specifically focus on discovering policy standpoints/perceptions pertaining to the Republic of India.</p>

<p>This specific post is inspired from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/the1owl/d/kaggle/hillary-clinton-emails/president-2016-nltk/code">this work</a>. The altered code to generate the below wordcloud image can be obtained from this <a href="https://github.com/viishaal/viishaal.github.io/blob/master/code/hillary_wc.py">link</a>.</p>

<p>The above wordcloud in generated from sample of emails mentioning <code class="highlighter-rouge">India</code>. You can analyze the full size image <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viishaal/viishaal.github.io/master/images/final.jpg">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the next post I will try to figure out which countries are mentioned most frequently when discussing India (probably a graph visualization).</p>
