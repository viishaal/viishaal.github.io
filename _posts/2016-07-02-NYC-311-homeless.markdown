To perform the below analysis I used NYC 311 complaints data from which I extracted years worth of homeless complaints. The 311 complaints data is made freely available here: [NYC 311 data][data_source]. The whole dataset is pretty huge so extract the right columns before doing further analysis.

I was interested in knowing how homeless complaints vary with days, months, seasons etc. So firstly I grouped homeless complaints by months in year 2015:

{% highlight ruby %}
require(leaflet)
require(plotly)
require(dplyr)
require(ggplot2)

df = read.csv("311_Service_Requests_from_2010_to_Present-3.csv", strip.white=TRUE)
#df_manhattan = df[grep("manhattan", df$Borough, ignore.case = TRUE),]   # if you want to restrict analysis to manhattan
dfh = df[grep("homeless", df$Complaint.Type, ignore.case = TRUE), ]

dfh$year = as.numeric(format(as.Date(dfh$Created.Date, format= "%m/%d/%Y"), "%Y"))
dfh$month = as.numeric(format(as.Date(dfh$Created.Date, format= "%m/%d/%Y"), "%m"))

dfh2015 = dfh[dfh$year=="2015",]
monthwise = dfh2015 %>%
            group_by(month) %>%
            summarise(total=n())

g3 = ggplot(data=monthwise) + geom_bar(aes(x=reorder(month_name, month), y=total), stat="identity", fill="blue", alpha=0.5)
g3 = g3 + labs(title="Monthwise Complaints for 2015", x="Month", y="Complaints")
g3

{% endhighlight %}

Interesting what's happening in December. So let's drill down:

{% highlight ruby %}

g3 = ggplot(data=day_wise[352:365, ]) + geom_bar(aes(x=date, y=total), stat="identity", fill="blue", alpha=0.5)
g3 = g3 + labs(title="December Homeless Complaints - 2015", x="Day", y="Complaints")
g3

{% endhighlight %}

Uh oh! One might expect the number of complaints to rise around Christmas time but there's actually a dip there. Maybe no one cares to complaint that day or not many are actually asking for alms.

And lets generally plot complaints grouped by days for the whole year of 2015:

{% highlight ruby %}

dfh2015$date = as.Date(dfh2015$Created.Date, format= "%m/%d/%Y")
day_wise = dfh2015 %>%
            group_by(date) %>%
            summarise(total=n())

g3 = ggplot(data=day_wise) + geom_bar(aes(x=date, y=total), stat="identity", fill="blue", alpha=0.5)
g3 = g3 + labs(title="Daywise Complaints for 2015", x="Day", y="Complaints")
g3

day_wise[which.max(day_wise$total),]

{% endhighlight %}

Does the December 25 pattern repeat for other holidays? I superimposed the [holidays][holiday_source] with `Red` dots on the above daywise graph:

{% highlight ruby %}

threshold=0.6
win_length = 3
MAX = 999999
vals = c()
idx = c()
for (i in 1:nrow(day_wise)) {
  val = day_wise$total[i]
  
  if (i > 3 && i < 363 && 
      any( (val - day_wise$total[(i-win_length):(i-1)])/day_wise$total[(i-win_length):(i-1)] > threshold &
            (val - day_wise$total[(i+1):(i+win_length+1)])/day_wise$total[(i+1):(i+win_length+1)] > threshold ) ) {
    vals = c(vals,day_wise$date[i])
    idx = c(idx, i)
  }
}
class(vals) = "Date"

fest_2015 = c(1,19,47,145,185,250,285,315,330,359)

g3 = ggplot(data=day_wise) + geom_bar(aes(x=date, y=total), stat="identity", fill="grey", alpha=0.8)
g3 = g3 + geom_point(data=day_wise[fest_2015,], aes(date, total), stat="identity", colour="red", size=3,alpha=0.8)
g3 = g3 + geom_bar(data=day_wise[idx,], aes(date, total), stat="identity", fill="blue")
g3 = g3 + labs(title="Red dot holidays 2015", x="Day", y="No. of Complaints")
g3

{% endhighlight %}

The yellow peaks are some sort of a local maximum. These are the days/points in the year when within both +3 days and -3 days window we find days when the homeless complaints drop to 60% of the number of complaints that were observed on that particular day.

Interesting insight that a local maxima usually occurs `around` the holiday/festival date and generally not on that particular day.
