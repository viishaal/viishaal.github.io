We recently began an initiative to impart non-technical people at International House (my residence and a place close to my heart!) some programming skills. The effort was based on a few conversations that I had with people coming from the field of journalism, social sciences etc and who had never used any other data analytics tool except Excel/Tableau etc and who really felt the need to acquire basic programming skills but feared the notions/concepts of programming (another reason why I feel that basic programming should be made a mandatory part of the curriculum in education).

We began this initiative at I-House to impart basic data literacy skills in Python and R through a series of workshops. Slides from the first workshop are [here][slides]. Basic programming constructs/paradigms (variables, functions, loops etc) were taught to the students which they had to apply in a data analytics [exercise] at the end. Online repl provided by [http://repl.it][repl] was used to save efforts in installation, setting the environment etc.
